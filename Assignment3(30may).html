            Hey! I'm Sanjana, who wrote my Class 12 exams this year, with a focus on Physics, Chemistry, 
            Mathematics and Computer Science and now, undertaking a bridge course for my first year in Chennai 
            Institute of Technology. I chose the department of Information Technology due to my strong interest 
            in technology and its fast-paced evolution.
        </P>
        <P style="text-align:justify; font-size: large;">
            In Class 11 and 12, I was taught Python and SQL, and how useful they are to building apps, websites 
            and managing data. While doing some programs, I was driven to doing more and more of them, which led 
            to my interest in programming and developing projects.
        </P>
        <P style="text-align:justify; font-size: large;">
            Beyond academics, I like reading books and crafting. I write essays and have won the Highly 
            Commendable Prize in writing an essay about Global Terrorism. I play badminton and am eager to learn 
            chess. I also like cooking and want to improve at it.  I am curious about learning foreign languages 
            and I am open to knowing different cultures and traditions.
        </P>

            During the next four years of college, while I have the chance of encountering various
            challenges, I want to stay consistent and shape my path to fit my goals and aspirations. I want to
            delve deep into building up my skills by practicing more coding, doing many projects, joining coding 
            clubs and going to hackathons. Most of all, I want to improve myself as a person and make use of the 
            opportunities I get. 
        </P>
